### MPG Prediction

We are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). 

We want to find the best fit model to predict MPG by using the dataset *mtcars* which was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models)

In this application, we found that only cyliders, horse powers, weights and transmission types played the important role on the prediction.

Please select the values on the left panel and then the result of prediction will be on the right hand side.
